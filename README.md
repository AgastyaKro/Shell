# Shell Implementation

This repository contains a custom implementation of a Unix-like shell. It supports essential shell functionalities, including command execution, built-in commands, quoting, and escaping.

## Features

- **Command Execution**:
  - Runs external commands such as `ls`, `cat`, `echo`, and more.
  - Automatically searches for binaries in the directories specified by the `PATH` environment variable.

- **Built-in Commands**:
  - `echo`: Prints the given arguments to standard output.
  - `pwd`: Displays the current working directory.
  - `cd`: Changes the current working directory.
  - `exit`: Exits the shell with an optional status code.
  - `type`: Identifies whether a command is a shell built-in or an external binary.

- **Quoting and Escaping**:
  - Handles single (`'`) and double (`"`) quotes to preserve arguments with spaces or special characters.
  - Supports escaping characters using the backslash (`\`) for literals or special sequences like `\n` (newline) and `\t` (tab).

- **Environment Variable Handling**:
  - Utilizes environment variables for operations such as locating binaries and resolving the home directory (`~`).

## How to Build and Run

### Prerequisites
- A C++17-compatible compiler (e.g., `g++` or `clang`).
- `make` (optional, if using CMake).

### Build Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AgastyaKro/Shell.git
   cd Shell
   ```
2. Compile the program using `g++`:
   ```bash
   g++ -std=c++17 -o shell src/main.cpp
   ```

3. Alternatively, use CMake:
   ```bash
   mkdir build
   cd build
   cmake ..
   make
   ```

### Run the Shell
Execute the compiled binary:
```bash
./shell
```

## Usage Examples

- Run a command:
  ```bash
  $ ls
  ```
- Use built-ins:
  ```bash
  $ pwd
  /home/user
  $ cd /tmp
  $ pwd
  /tmp
  ```
- Quoting and escaping:
  ```bash
  $ echo "Hello, world!"
  Hello, world!
  $ echo This\ is\ escaped
  This is escaped
  ```

## Project Structure

- `src/`: Contains the main source file `main.cpp`.
- `README.md`: Documentation for the project.

## Future Enhancements

- Add support for pipes (`|`) and redirection (`>`, `<`).
- Implement job control (e.g., background processes).
- Expand built-in commands.
